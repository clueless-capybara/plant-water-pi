## What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Daniel: server-side JS, AWS
Miranda: collaborative, time management
Nate: resourceful, logical, time management
Kawika: flexible, creative, front-end
Kam: creative, collaborative

## How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

The team can divide the task up evenly, in case a member of the team that aren't participating in the process or are done early can assisst and help set up the backend and other features not yet complete.
Meeting in the morning to report progress, see where we are schedule-wise, identify the daily objective. Then everyone work on their part of choice (from the Trello), and move on with the day.

## In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

## Communication Plan

Speak up. We can take group votes if needed to go for the majority.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
The team will keep track of what each person did on Trello. And the group member that's taking over the tasks should claim less tasks and allow other members to take some tasks on their own. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We break down the task to as small as we can (without sacrificing efficiency), so each person can pick the task they believe it's to their skill level. If there's question, bring it up during the morning progress meeting. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Speak to the person see what the person is stuck on. It's more likely the person is struggling than purposefully not contributing. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
IF more than one member noticing a person is not contributing, and no resolution arises after speaking to the person, it's when we esclate to ask for outside help. Communication Plan Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
We will use Slack during class time, and texts over the weekend.

## Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate?

Work hours, 9-6. What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack and phone. How often will you take breaks
As needed.

## What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
We can re-identify the MVP, and correspond with the progress. We can try to stay behind to catch up, if it's not feasible, we will adjust the MVP.

## How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Phone.

## What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
We make sure everyone speaks in the morning meeting, and make sure everyone's question is heard.

## How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Don't shot down ideas, don't redicule team member's ideas and questions.

## Work Plan

## How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

We will be using the trello board to track, plan and execute tasks.

The team can divide the task up evenly, in case a member of the team that aren't participating in the process or are done early can assisst and help set up the backend and other features not yet complete.
Meeting in the morning to report progress, see where we are schedule-wise, identify the daily objective. Then everyone work on their part of choice (from the Trello), and move on with the day.

trello, slack.

## What components of your project will live on GitHub?


## How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Collaboration.
